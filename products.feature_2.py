Scenario: Delete a Product

    When I visit the "Home Page"

    And I set the "Name" to "Hat"

    And I press the "Search" button

    Then I should see the message "Success"

    And I should see "A red fedora" in the "Description" field

    And I press the "Clear" button

    And I paste the "Id" field
